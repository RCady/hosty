## What is hosty?
Hosty is a simple CLI used to setup, and manage a shared LAMP web hosting environment. Image CPanel, but only accessible from the terminal window.

## Why Hosty?
Currently I work as a web developer on the LAMP stack, and setting up simple hosting environments for clients is something that I do quite often, and it's about time for it to be much easier.
